        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            First off, I want to figure out how to access the webcam (without the use of plugins).  After that
            I will add a record, and stop button.  When the recording is stopped it will be put into a &lt;video&gt;
            tag.  This way users can preview their work.  After all of that has been finished, the next step
            will be utilizing the microphone, and also including it into the &lt;video&gt; element.
            <br><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            After I have the base of the program done, the next step is to enable downloading to disk,
            AND to drive.  The former one will take some research to figure out how to enable that, but
            for the latter, I will utilize the REST API (Application Program Interface), which is the
            main Google API, so that I can download to drive.  I will most likely finish the second one
            first because it is more useful to be able to download to drive at our school, due to our
            heavy use of chromebooks.
            <br><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            The final step will be the GUI (Graphical User Interface).  My current plan for the GUI is to have
            the container for the application be partition into three parts.  Bottom half, will be the timeline,
            there will be a video, and audio timeline, I will have to look up how to choose individual frames
            from the overall picture for the video timeline, and for the audio timeline, I will use the HTML5
            &lt;canvas&gt; element to draw the audio visulization on the timeline.
            <br><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            The top half of the application container would be subdiveded into two parts.  One would be 60% of
            the total width, the other would be 40% of the width.  The larger of the two would contain the download
            buttons for drive, the direct download, a audio record, a video record, and a record video & audio.  
            The other pane would contain a video element that functions as a preview for the finished product.
